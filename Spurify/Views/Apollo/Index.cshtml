            Apollo is a simple music discovery tool that utilizes the Spotify API. Apollo allows for users to discover
            new albums through an initial album seed, which is used to populate a list of albums from artists similar to
            the selected album's artist. Apollo stores all albums that have been listened to in order to always provide
            new albums that have not been heard by the user. Through liking albums, the new albums recommended becomes
            broader as similar artists to the liked album's artists are acquired.
            <br /><br />
